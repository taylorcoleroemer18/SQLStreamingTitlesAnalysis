# ðŸŽ¬ Streaming Titles Analysis SQL Project

This project analyzes a database of movies and TV shows across multiple streaming platforms to explore content distribution, genre diversity, and original vs. licensed productions.

---

## ðŸ“Š Objectives

- Count total titles per streaming platform  
- Calculate percentage share of titles by platform  
- Analyze original vs. licensed content proportions  
- Compare domestic (U.S.) vs. international content  
- Measure genre diversity and find the most common genre per platform  

---

## ðŸ§  Key SQL Concepts Used

- Table creation and data insertion  
- Aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`)  
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)  
- Window functions (`RANK() OVER`)  
- Conditional aggregation with `CASE WHEN`  
- Percentage calculations and rounding  
- Grouping and filtering data
